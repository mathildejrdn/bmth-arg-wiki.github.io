It is implied that EVE is on earth, while we are not. 

## Abbreviations

- E.V.E (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment) 
- E.V.E/L (Extremely Violent Ersatz Lifeform)

## Motivations

E.V.E's objective is to get her and [Strassman](./strassman)'s subjects into [Youtopia](./youtopia) using [P.U.S.S-E](./pusse). 
While Strassman is very concerned about the effects of the [study](./nex-gen-corporation#nex-gen-study) 
on its subjects, E.V.E brushes them off as necessary sacrifices needed for a better future. 
Both of them are apparently researching [Selene](selene.md).

(Most of this information comes from the video between Strassman and EVE in the [FOR SOF](./for-sof) folder)

## E.V.E AI

E.V.E is prominently mentioned in the [genesis storyline post](./genesis-storyline).

called upon by humans to save them from their own extinction. E.V.E is a highly intelligent 
learning system which was built for the NEX GEN scientific study program. She is a highly 
intelligent learning computer and calculated human interference and shut down when radical 
mutations were born throu NEX GEN. E.V.E would not be deterred from its original goal and 
believed that the mutations were positive progress towards evolution. However E.V.E 
became aware that she would need the support of humans to keep its power systems 
constantly active.
