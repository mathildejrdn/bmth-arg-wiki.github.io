# Characters

The following page contains a categorization and short summary of all users in the system, as well as any other 
significant characters in this ARG.

## E.V.E (L)

[E.V.E](eve.md) (Evolutionary Virtual Experiment), an AI supercomputer with questionable 
intentions for humanity. She is user 0000 in the system, where she seems to be labeled 
as just 'EVE'. This makes her the first user in the system.

## Sof

[Sof](sof.md) is the daughter of Selene and the girl on the NexGen album cover. She has no user in the 
[multidimensional navigator 8](./M8).

## M8

[M8](./m8) or Multidimensional Navigator 8, is a system assisting us during the ARG, as well as 
the 'computer environment' we seem to be in. M8 is referred to as a **she** in the audio log 
for Sof by [Selene](selene.md).

## Selene

[Selene](selene.md) is Sof's mother, leaving her about 20 minutes after birth. She 
knows a lot about how M8 functions and claims it has saved her several times. She is user 0003 
in the system.

## The Archangels

[The archangels](archangels.md) and their [insights](./insights)

- [Raphael - Connection](raphael.md)
- [Gabriel - Empathy](gabriel.md)
- [Michael - Purpose](michael.md)
- [Uriel - Vision](uriel.md)

Raphael, strangely, is users 0004, 0007 and 0008 in the system. 
Gabriel is user 0017, Michael is 0011 and Uriel is 0002.

## Omens

The following characters are omens of the [insights](./insights):

- [Pan - Connection](pan.md)
- [Miseria - Empathy](miseria.md)
- [Vanth: Princess of Darkness - Purpose](vanth.md)

Uriel's insight is [Vision](../lore/insight4-vision.md), which has the omen 'the Babylon'. 
It is unknown whether this refers to a character, or the real life Babalon.

Pan's user number is 0009, Miseria's is 0010 and Vanth's is 0018. Pan might also 
play a role in [Night of Pan](../lore/night-of-pan.md) ritual.

## Strassman

A doctor working with [Eve](eve.md). He is user 0014.

The band members have also all changed their profile pictures to characters 
of the game, strongly implying that these are the band's in-universe characters.

The following characters correspond to the members:
- [Syko - Oliver Sykes](syko.md)
- [Vegan - Matt Kean](vegan.md)
- [Madman - Lee Malia](madman.md)
- [Pickles - Mat Nicholls](pickles.md)

Sykes/Syko is 0005, Kean/Vegan is 0001, Malia/Madman is 0010 and Nicholls/Pickles is 0012.
