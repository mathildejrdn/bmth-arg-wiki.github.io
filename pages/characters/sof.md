# SOF

Sof is the girl from the cover art. She is referred to as such in several descriptions 
on the Horizon merch website.

It seems that the bear pictured with her is called VEX from the Horizon merch listings.

While she originated from earth, as stated by [M8](./m8), she does not currently seem to reside there.

*"I can also chat with our home planet; Earth. Realtime data transfer straight to the all powerful and all glorious EVE! 
She's the big boss. The head honcho. The one pulling the strings! Anything we find, Eve knows about it instantly. 
So, no pressure."*
- [M8](./m8) when prompted with "Who are u?"

## Accessing M8

Access was gained to [Multidimensional Navigator 8](./m8) (M8) through a QR code 

## FOR SOF

[`FOR SOF`](./for-sof) was a puzzle in the ARG that was solved shortly after its inception. This refers to a folder on the 
computer of the [webpage](./webpage), which can be opened using the password `past`.

## Art

## Speculation

She is theorized to also be on the cover of Post Human: Survival Horror. The NexGen album cover 
seems to show her with her third eye sewn shut. While the timeline is generally assumed to be 
linear (i.e. PH1 comes before PH2 in the timeline), there is still some discussion around the timeline.
