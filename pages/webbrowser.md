- Full error code: `error_tp10a2uhd7amnSTCB`
- Full default URL: `surfr.news/2d85da7-f5cc-45a4-ad44`

## Current findings

- Error code likely refers (partially) to [Top 10 Statues That Cried Blood](music/song-top10.md)
- When the first URL changed, it lead to the password for the [DREADIT file](files/dreadit.md) being unlocked.

## Previous findings

- Before the DREADIT file, you could type in the address bar. This did not lead to any clues.
