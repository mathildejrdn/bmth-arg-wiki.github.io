## Band member's Instagram

The band members have all updated their profile pictures and have a corresponding characters 
in the ARG universe, being [Syko (Sykes)](../characters/syko.md), [Vegan (Kean)](../characters/vegan.md), [Madman (Malia)](../characters/madman.md)

The band themselves post on at least Instagram, YouTube and Facebook (which may be better in terms of picture
