We find a storage crate that belongs to [Selene](../characters/selene.md). From the messages we see in the Kodek, 
it seems that Selene is the person we are logged in as when we boot in safe mode using the 
code 93934521.

If you followed the instructions in the past, you may have received the following response, 
warning you that this secret was not supposed to be discovered yet. The email address was 
confirmed by the official moderators to be a placeholder. While they are aware of the 
community figuring this out the intended way, they have asked us **not to email the 
placeholder address anymore**.

*SYSTEM BREACH!* Re: [your email subject]
M8 here!!!

It appears you've illicitly hacked into the M8 server to decode hidden
secrets. As the ever-diligent M8, it's my duty to inform you that this
behaviour is both naughty and counterproductive!

You see, the whole idea of this program is to unravel the mysteries at
a tantalizing pace, allowing everyone to enjoy the thrill of
discovery. By bypassing the system and sharing the secrets
prematurely, you're spoiling the fun for everyone! It's like eating
all the popcorn before the movie even starts.

So a friendly warning: your recent unauthorized access to our website
has not gone unnoticed. While I admire your enthusiasm, it's time to
address the consequences of your actions.

If you continue to hack into the system, you'll be permanently blocked
from accessing any part of it. This means no more juicy secrets, no
more thrilling discoveries, and certainly no more supply drops or
physical items being sent to your physical location. In addition, your
address and identity will be blacklisted, ensuring you’re completely
cut off from our network.
So, let’s play fair and enjoy the journey together. After all, a
little patience goes a long way in making the experience truly
enjoyable for everyone.

So stop being a dipshit, and play fair!

The email ends with an ASCII art rendering of M8, which has been screencaptured to preserve this 
authentic artwork.
