Nex Gen weirdness Nex Gen Claims They Found a Girl Immune to VSPR-37 - I'm already 
rolling my 3rd eye 

So, I've been going down the mother of all rabbit holes on Spyder this weekend and 
wanna know if anyone else is on this shit- cos I dunno whether to laugh, cry or be 
scared shitless. So we all know ever since our parents laid the world to waste and 
handled the VSPR-37 virus worse than my guts handle taco Tuesday, we've been living 
in a circus of psycho billionaires and suss corpo's peddling breakthroughs and miracles 
that will supposedly get us back to a pre-pandemic utopia, whatever that looked like. Well, 
everyones favourite Al run megalordz Nex Gen is back on the scene, cos apparently ruling 
planet earth isn't enough (they own 89 percent of the trade network, mainly due to their 
world wide GAIA REHAB facilities, which if ur reading this from one of those shitholes, 
I'm sorry) 

Ok strap in, cos what's coming out on these lunatics is out of this fucking 
world (pun intended) 

'trusted' (lol) sources are reporting that NEXGEN have found a 
young girl who's immune. Yeah, immune. And apparently, it's all because of her pineal 
gland. 

Apparently this kid's nodes on overdrive, producing DMT like there's no tomorrow. 
For those out of the loop, This gland, often called the "brain jewel" by new age weirdos, 
might be more than just a part of our noggin, and DMT is that hallucinogenic stuff 
linked to dreams and spiritual bollox, but of which the majority of us dont really 
produce anymore because of Skyveins and fluoride or some shit. If u ask me I reckon 
the latter was just made up by stinky hippies due to their aversion of personal hygiene. 

So, these Nex Gen quacks claim a turbo-charged pineal gland is not only linked to 
immunity 
But are suggesting it could unlock a state of consciousness that helps us 
escape this post-apocalyptic shit tip. 

Rumour has it they are building a device supposedly called DREAMSEEKER that, coupled 
with high amounts of DMT can trigger the same spiritual reaction as powerful ancient 
rituals such as the LBRP (among others) and take the user outta this dystopian nightmare 
into some perfect dream world. Lost? Yeah me too.

If you want to know more about the NEOSAGES & their sacred rituals such as the LBRP 
click here although let me save you the effort, it's basically Western esoteric 
nonsense which is supposed to create a sacred space and bring the practitioner 
into alignment with their higher self- Jesus, I'm bering myself just typing this garbage.

Who's Pulling the Strings?
Meet Dr. Karl Strassman, the nutter leading this spectacle, Known for his crackpot 
theories on human consciousness and evolution, Strassman's teamed up with Nex Gen's 
suss AF Al supercomputer, to unlock the pineal gland's secrets.

Here's where it gets even bleaker. What is almost certainly true from all reports, 
is theyve been doing these studies on countless people, mostly kids, and that even 
though its almost certain they are lying about this one kids supposed immunity, this 
kid exists, and cannot leave the facility, i fool for her, but I mean, if ur dumb 
enough to go sign up for a project like that, you kinda had it coming

It all gets almost a bit too ridiculous to even bother retyping, but theres talks 
EVE believes she can bottle this miracle-child's unique alkaloid structure and 
supply it to the unsuspecting public, transporting us all to a shiny brand new 
perfect world. Wouldn't that be nice huh?

Daftest shit I've heard since the kingslayer prophecies.

Thoughts?

Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I expected! Thanks for the upvotes and all the bleak 
comments, Im deffo going to look into some of these other cover-ups of NEX GEN, 
seem even more cursed that I knew. (How have I never heard of the O-BAE peacekeeper 
scandal!?) Keep the theories coming - I'll update if I find out more.

i actually agree w you on a lot of this, theres defo some sketchy things happening around there, my buddy used to work in disposal at our local gaia facility & he was always finding weird shit in the dumpsters, things he said he couldn't even bring himself to repeat. All he did say was that he once found some weird cloaks with a weird logo on.
