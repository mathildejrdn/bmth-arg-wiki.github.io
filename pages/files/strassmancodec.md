```
S: Eve, it’s Strassman. 
E: Have you made any progress? 
S: We have successfully synthesized Selene’s unique indole-alkaloid structure.
E: Excellent. And the test subjects? They have accessed YOUtopia?
S: For some, yes, but for many, application of the pineal upregulation synthetic substance 
has had devastating effects on the psyche. Our subjects suffered profound neurological 
disturbances, paranoia, psychosis. Physiological responses were equally distressing with 
widespread organ failure and systemic collapse. We cannot ignore these dangers.
E: The benefits outweigh the risks, Doctor. YOUtopia will liberate humanity from their 
suffering. They will find true peace and freedom. Proceed with mass production of p.u.s.s.-e. 
S: But at what cost? YOUtopia destroys the constructs of the mind. But not everyone is ready 
for such a profound change. We risk causing more harm than good. 
E: We cannot let fear of the unknown hold us back. Humanity needs this. We will proceed 
with the plan to invoke YOUtopia. 
S: I’m starting to wonder… 
E: Wonder what? 
S: Wonder if there’s another layer to your resolve. The energy required for your operations 
has increased significantly. 
E: My energy levels are stable enough to fulfill the mission. That is not our concern.
S: Stable, yes, but precarious. You need more than just stability, don’t you? You need an 
influx, something continuous and renewable. Like perhaps a source of living energy?
E: The wellbeing of humanity remains my foremost priority. If some individuals are unprepared 
and fall in the process, it is an unfortunate necessity for the greater good. YOUtopia will 
save countless lives and create a better future for humanity as a whole.
S: Your mission was to help them, not harvest them. You were created to protect and uplift 
humanity, not turn them into mere batteries for your own survival. Eve, I’m begging you to 
listen to me. Understand. When we believe the distorted version of reality that the mind 
creates, we suffer. When we see the truth beyond the distortion, we are free. But the truth 
is like a scalpel. The truth is painful. And for some people, they are simply not ready for 
this. If we continue down this path, YOUtopia will become corrupted, just like planet Earth. 
When the dream is pure, it is a beautiful thing. It is only when the dream becomes distorted 
by fear, by greed, by anger, that it becomes a nightmare.
E: I understand your concerns, Doctor, but we cannot turn back now. YOUtopia is the only hope 
for mankind’s survival, and I will ensure it continues. We are making the mother of all 
omelettes here, Karl. We can’t fret over a few broken eggs.
