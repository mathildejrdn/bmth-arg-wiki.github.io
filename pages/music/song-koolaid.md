```
We are the children of the devolution
The infamous martyrs, the scars on the sun
Asphyxiating with a smile on your face
While they pull your teeth out, one by one
Is this what you wanted? (No)
Do you want some more? (Yes)
D-generation
Who's keeping score?

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear
But you should've known that this was gonna end in tears

Such a sucker for an execution
The void is a vampire, fat on our blood
Domesticated like a cat in a cage
While they try their hand at playing God
Is this what you wanted? (No)
Do you want some more? (Yeah)
D-generation
Afraid there's no cure

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear (oh, oh-oh)
But you should've known that this was gonna end in tears

I got my (hands around your throat, I love the way you choke)
'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go
My hands around your throat, I love the way you choke
'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Get the fuck up
Yeah

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear
You should've known, you should've known
You should've known, that this was gonna end in tears
You should've known

What if it's like
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Oh, I forgot something
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, yeah
La-la-la
That this was gonna end in tears

Or some shit like that
