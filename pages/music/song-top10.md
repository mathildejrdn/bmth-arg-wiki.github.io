Lyric video starts with: Top 10 staTues tHat CriEd bloOd (2x)
```
I guesS tHat somE of us Are jUst boRN wiTh trAgedy IN our bloOd, It’s Just basIC cHemistry
Or MAybe all these opeN wounds Is how the LiGht gets into yoU
Cos I’m sTaRting to reAlIse
No onE’s goNna coMe and REscue mE,
I’m droWning in mY sleEp,
The scaRs have goT too deep
And no amount of loVe couLd Set yoU fRee
The fIght’s INSIDe I’ll take myself to hell and bacK
TonIgHt we go to WaR
(Unicursal Hexagram Symbol)
Someone put A guN StrAight to our hearTs And paiNt tHe waLLs WiTh our loVe
There’s A worLd of hurt In uS and maybe oNce we spill our guts We can stITcH ourselvEs baCk up
YeAh I’m startiNg to reAliSe
No one’s gonNa coME and ResCUe mE
I’m dRowniNg in my sLEEp
The scarS hAve goT too deEP
And no amoUNt of lOve couLd SeT yoU FRee
The figHt’s insiDe I’ll taKe myseLf to hell and bAck
TonighT we go To war
(Church of Genxsis Symbol)
Cos i kNow That yoU’rE loW
But once yoU hit tHe boTTom at leaSt therE’s nowheRe to gO buT up
Yeah i knoW ThAt you’rE LOw
But once you hiT tHe bOttom At leaSt therE’s nowheRe to gO buT up
(Church of Genxsis Symbol)
YEAh The hardesT thiNg yoU’ll ever know
(Unicursal Hexagram Coin)
Is tHere’S no love lIKe yOur oWN
No theRe’s no lovE liKE yoUr own
No one’s gonnA comE And ReSCuE me
I’m dRowniNg iN my sLeeP
The scaRs havE got tOO deep
And no amounT of loVE could SeT you fRee
THe fight’s insiDe i’ll taKe mySELf to heLL and back
No oNe’s gonnA cOMe and rescuE mE
I’m DrownING In my sleEp
The scaRs hAve goT too deep
And no amount oF love coULd SEt yOU fReE
The figHT’s inside I’ll take myselF to hell anD BAck
TonigHt we go to wAr
