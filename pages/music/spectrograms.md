## R.i.p. (duskCOre Remix)

Contains an image of a skull, with characters above and below that have not been identified. This song also 
contains a small audio fragment from the game Undertale, specifically to a skeleton named Sans. The skull is likely a 
reference and might not be a clue to the ARG itself.

## Songs that do not contain spectrograms

The songs that are not mentioned in the section above on NexGen are assumed not to have any hidden images. 
In this section we also explore songs and albums that have been checked, but not yielded any result.

### Website Songs

The songs found on the website do not seem to contain any more hidden spectrogram imagery.

### Post Human: Survival Horror

The album [Post Human: Survival Horror](./ph-survival-horror) does not seem to contain anything of note in the spectrograms. The exception 
to this might be "Itch for the Cure", as some interesting patterns have been spotted there.

### Amo

Some songs on amo also sound glitched, leading users to check for spectograms unsuccessfully.

## Code Mistake

Corpse is the main artist on this track and BMTH is a feature, but since the song seems to contain relevant themes it 
was unsuccessfully checked for spectrograms.

## U Know/Rescue Me

This demo was ripped from YouTube and checked for spectrograms, but did not yield any results.
