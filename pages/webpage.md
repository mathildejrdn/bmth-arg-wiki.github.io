# Webpage

Most of the ARG takes place in the Multidimensional Navigator. You can access 
it with the following link.

`https://www.multidimensionalnavigator8.help/index-desktop.html`

![An overview of the webpage](Resources/webpage/webpage-overview.png)

The dashboard upon login, after the [weather module](#weather-module) was changed.

## Password

Password: 93934521

The password to boot in safe mode is the serial number on the side of M8's
head. It can be found on the album cover (although the serial number is very tiny).

## QR Code

The QR code for the website was found at the end of the [spectrogram](music/spectrograms.md) in the song DIg It.

## Website contents

The web page leads us to what looks like a personal computer. Here we can find some music, 
some avatars corresponding to different characters and more. We have a folder on our computer [FOR SOF](files/for-sof.md), 
which will be the next step to unlocking the mysteries of Youtopia.

### Access card

![](Resources/webpage/access-card2.png)

This access card seems to indicate who we are accessing the [Multidimensional Navigator 8](./m8) 
as.

The content seems to read as following:
```
ACCESS CARD MS: M8 [illegible]-OK!

NEX GEN presents [Dreamseeker variant] 2024 OST + A POST HUMAN STUDY (phase II)

PATIENT 00029

ACCESS LVL 2

PH2222 0036

Nex Gen (93)

NG (symbol) MB (symbol) P.u.s.s-e (symbol)
```

The text below mentions something about two doses of [p.u.s.s.-e](lore/pusse.md) a day and 
going 'deeper'.

### Youtopia Stability Meter

### Buttons

The page also provides a button to manage your Wi-fi, which will likely be needed to access the browser. 
The kodek messaging app also states that it needs a connection to the internet.
