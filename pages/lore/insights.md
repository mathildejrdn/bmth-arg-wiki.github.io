# The Four Insights

The first hint about the four insights was found in a spectogram of the song YOUtopia.

The program Audacity is an easily available alternative to achieve the same results.

Around 3:48 in the song, the message is hidden.

## Insight Spectograms

The following songs also contain hidden images related to the insights:
- [Top 10 staTues tHat CriEd bloOd](../music/song-top10.md) (Connection)
- [n/A](../music/song-na.md) (Empathy)
- [puss-e](../music/song-pusse.md) (Purpose)
- [DIg It](../music/song-digit.md) (Vision)

Please explore their articles for more details.

## Introduction to the Insights

The [FOR SOF](../files/for-sof.md) folder contains a document `THEINSIGHTS.doc` that introducees us
to the insights.

Note that this document states that each insight comes with an omen and a curse. 
The omens are mentioned in the documents for the insights, but the curses are not.

All the insights also contains a reference to the four elements: air, water, fire and earth. 
Additionally, [posts on instagram](../socials/social-posts.md) indicate that there might 
be a fifth element we need to identify.

Each insight is also linked to a specific region in [Youtopia](youtopia.md), as indicated on 
[Selene's map](./for-sof#YOUTOPIA_selenes_map.vis).

The following four insights are the ones referred to throughout the ARG. 
They are assigned numbers according to the folder structure for `FOR SOF`. 
They make the most sense if read in the original order.

1. [Connection - Air](insight1-connection.md)
2. [Empathy - Water](insight2-empathy.md)
3. [Purpose - Fire](insight3-purpose.md)
4. [Vision - Earth](insight4-vision.md)

The ARG follows symbolism from real life around the four classical elements.

The four insights also seem to be directly linked to the in-universe [characters](../characters/characters.md#the-band-members) 
for the band.

The fourth document ends with the conclusion that we need to apply the insights.

## The Fifth Insight

While there was speculation, the fifth insight first seems to be confirmed through Selene's map.

Reference on Bring Me The Horizon's Instagram story.

The pentagram that often occurs in the ARG also represents five elements, being: 
water, earth, fire, air and **spirit**.
