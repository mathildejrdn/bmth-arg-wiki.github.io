# P.U.S.S-E

*This page refers to the concept within the ARG, not the [song](../song-pusse.md).*

P.U.S.S-E is short for Pineal Upregulation Synthetic Substrance Enhanced, 
as seen in promotional posts.

P.U.S.S-E seems to be a drug, implied by instagram posts, a pill bottle at the end of the spectrogram in 
[the song](../song-pusse.md) and additional promotional information. The stylization of puss-e (like P.u.s.s-e) is 
different between the tracklist and the instagram.

Promotional post from the BMTH instagram, see page on [social posts](../socials/social-posts.md)

The small text on the access card on the main ARG page also recommends two doses 
of P.U.S.S-E a day for this patient.
