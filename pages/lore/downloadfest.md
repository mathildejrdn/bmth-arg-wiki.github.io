# Downloadfest

The Downloadfest event introduced [the Church of Genesis](church.md) and 
seems to hold lore significance. 

## Website

The [website for downloadfest](https://www.genxsis.faith/) is still up and 
contains a cypher.

The cypher can be obtained by clicking the symbol in the upper right corner.

It is sometimes used to spell out "BRING ME THE HORIZON" (pictured above) or "NEX GEN" on 
current [promotional material](../socials).
