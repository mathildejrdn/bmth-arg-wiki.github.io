# Welcome to Youtopia

Welcome to this (currently small) wiki about BMTH's NexGen ARG. This is a work in progress. 
This wiki will focus on objective information as much as possible and indicate whenever something is not confirmed.

## Getting started

Some tips on getting into the ARG:
- Listen to the album first!
- Explore the [band's Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/bringmethehorizon/)
- Step 1 of the ARG itself is to get into the [webpage](pages/webpage)
- Join the hunt on Reddit or Discord.

## Collaborators and conspirators

Want to get in on the project? Let us know in the Discord ARG server or email to 
bmthargwiki@gmail.com.

You will need:
- A GitHub account
- A Markdown editor (like Dillinger)
- Some knowledge of markdown that is super easy to pick up.
